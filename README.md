Bike Type Classifier is an AI-powered web application developed using Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project uses a pre-trained deep learning model (MobileNetV2) to classify different types of bikesâ€”such as sports bikes, cruisers, and scootersâ€”based on uploaded images.
Users can upload an image of a bike through a simple and responsive web interface. The image is then processed and passed to the trained model, which predicts the type of bike with high accuracy. The prediction result is displayed instantly along with the uploaded image.
This project demonstrates the practical integration of machine learning and full-stack web development. It is useful for AI-based object recognition tasks, vehicle cataloging platforms, or educational purposes.

Features:

Upload any bike image and classify it in real-time
Deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras
Full-stack implementation with Django backend
Clean and responsive frontend interface
Model trained on custom image dataset

ðŸ“Š Output:

Real-time predictions displayed with image previews
Easy-to-understand UI with classification result
